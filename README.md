# Vegetable Classifier App

Welcome to the Vegetable Classifier App, an tool designed to classify images of vegetables. The app currently classifies 5 vegetables: 
 - Carrot
 - Tomato
 - Capsicum
 - Potato
 - Broccoli

## Features
Our app comes packed with features to make vegetable classification as easy as pressing a button:

 - Camera Integration: The application offers a straightforward camera functionality, allowing users to effortlessly capture images directly within the app for immediate classification.

 - Gallery Selection: For those who prefer utilizing pre-existing photos, the app provides an option to browse and select images from the device's gallery for classification.

 - Instant Prediction: By simply pressing the 'Predict' button, users can quickly obtain the classification of the vegetable depicted in the image, thanks to our advanced instant prediction technology.

I have personally trrained the ML model on a dataset of over 5,000 images, which ensures accurate and reliable classifications across five different vegetable types.

## Demonstration of the app
